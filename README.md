## What we have done
1) We reimplemented the **original article:** [code2vec by U. Alon et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09473.pdf).
2) We improved _F1-score_ on the test dataset of java14m-data [here you can find dataset](https://github.com/tech-srl/code2vec).
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |


If you want to run it, you have two stepts:
1) Open notebook, for example in collab by link below and run all cells.

2) Without notebook: 
* **./download data.sh** 
* **python3 for_test_file.py**.

First one download data and the second one start learning process.
